The icon are both 50 * 50. 

If you want to change them, I would suggest loading both images in a image editor.
After that, you can just load your image over it & if needed, erase mine with a eraser.

Tips:

1. Make sure your background is transparant, otherwise it won't look good.

2. If the height & width doesn't look good, you can change it in Menu.mm file
  - For the menu icon:
    - On line 85, you see two times "50", the first one is width & the last one is height.

  - For the menu button:
    - On line 230, you see two times "50", the first one is width & the last one is height.
